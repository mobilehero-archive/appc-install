## Appcelerator Installer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/appcelerator/appc-install.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/appcelerator/appc-install) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/appcelerator.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/appcelerator)

This is the installer for the Appcelerator Platform software stack.

## Installation

Install globally using npm such as (if using Windows, don't use sudo prefix):

```bash
$ [sudo] npm install appcelerator -g
```

This adds two binary executable commands: `appcelerator` or the shortcut `appc`.

Once installed, you should run setup such as:

```bash
$ appc setup
```

This will install the latest version of the Appcelerator Platform tooling.  Once installed, you can then run the various commands.  To get a valid list of commands, run help:

```bash
$ appc help
```

## Switching Versions

By default, the latest downloaded version will be used.  You can switch to a newer or older version with the use command:

```bash
$ appc use 1.2.0
```

This will switch the active version to 1.2.0.  If you don't have this version installed locally, it will fetch this version and download it.

To get a list of all the available versions for download:

```bash
$ appc use

The following versions are available:

0.0.97     Installed (Latest) (Active)              Sat Dec 27 2014 22:37:03 GMT-0800 (PST)
